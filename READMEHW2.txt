====================
To compile:
gcc -o pipes pipes.c

There are 3 ways to run the file after compilation
1. doing ./pipes you can enter a string yourself and it will convert what you typed to uppercase
2. cat text.txt | ./pipes converts everything in the txt file to uppercase
3. ./pipes < text.txt converts everything in the txt file to uppercase


Description
===========
